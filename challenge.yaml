    solution: >
      Stregobar is hiding in his tower and isn't coming out; Help Geralt avenge Renfri by exploiting one of his many clients. There are two services running: on ports 5001 and 9999. Watch out though, there is a catch, the service running on 1337 is hiding locally and responds only to the following command: http://localhost:1337/flag

      Stregobar has TWO flags in total, take them both and he will come running out so you can strike him down for good. 
    achievables:
        - flag: ccsc{6f759aae73d7be951b5482b1e0146b0c}
          points: 250
        - flag: ccsc{eba43052b3fc1d5cdcf0a8809e0bdbdd}
          points: 100
